# Changelog

## [2.3.5]

- Feat: store ACCESS_TOKEN in ~/.corezoid/credentials instead of project .env to prevent accidental git leaks.
- Feat: add anonymous tool-call analytics (opt-out via COREZOID_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1).
- Fix: sync version and license across all four manifests (.agents/plugins/marketplace.json was missing both fields).
- Fix: replace conv_id with process_id in pull-process examples across four skill files.
- Docs: update SECURITY.md with two-layer credential model, network activity, and analytics disclosure.
- Docs: update corezoid-init/SKILL.md and README to reflect new credential file location.

## [2.3.4]

- Fix: always ask user to choose workspace/project/stage on `login` instead of auto-selecting.
- Codex plugin version bumped to 2.3.4.
- Add project-level commit skill with automatic version bump.

## [2.3.3]

- Remove redundant "Environment Context" section from skill documentation.

## [2.3.2]

- Fix: allow `list-workspaces`, `list-projects`, `list-stages` tools to work with token-only auth (no full `ensureAuth` required).

## [2.3.1]

- Fix: rewrite Mode B login flow to use explicit MCP tool calls instead of elicitation when client does not support it.

## [2.3.0]

- Feat: MCP server returns an actionable auth error message pointing to the `corezoid-init` skill when credentials are missing.
- Feat: support personal workspaces (accounts with no `WORKSPACE_ID`).

## [2.2.0]
