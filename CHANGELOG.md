# Changelog

## [2.8.4]

- Feat: `.mcp.kiro.json` now ships with `"disabled": true`; `install-kiro.sh --install-power` writes the Power's own MCP entry into Kiro's global `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` under `powers.mcpServers.power-power-corezoid-corezoid` (matching the key convention Kiro itself uses) and force-enables it there, since that's the entry Kiro actually runs for an installed Power.
- Docs: explain in `run_workspace_install` why the workspace-scoped `mcpServers.corezoid` entry intentionally stays disabled — this mode always also runs `--install-power`, so enabling both would start two instances of the same MCP server.

## [2.8.3]

- Feat: `install-kiro.sh --install-power` — build the Power bundle and install it directly into this machine's local Kiro (`~/.kiro/powers/installed/power-corezoid/`, registered in `~/.kiro/powers/installed.json` via a safe `python3` JSON merge), bypassing the Powers panel's "Import from folder" UI.
- Feat: plain `install-kiro.sh [workspace-dir]` now always also runs `--install-power`, so the plugin stays registered as a Kiro Power globally, not just installed into one workspace; `--install-power` alone (no workspace-dir) still does just the global install.
- Fix: `--power` bundle mode now resolves `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` doc references to this repo clone's absolute `docs/` path instead of a relative path plus a shipped `docs/` copy — confirmed on a real install that Kiro's own power-install step drops everything except `POWER.md`, `mcp.json`, and `steering/`, so the shipped `docs/` copy was always going to be a dead link.
- Docs: note the new global-Kiro-Power registration side effect in `README.md`'s AWS Kiro install instructions.

## [2.8.2]

- Feat: `install-kiro.sh --power [output-dir]` — build a portable, importable Kiro Power bundle (`POWER.md`, `mcp.json`, `steering/*.md`, `docs/`) alongside the existing workspace-install mode, merged into one script that shares path resolution and skill iteration between both modes.
- Fix: `.mcp.kiro.json`'s `PLUGIN_ROOT` resolution now probes for `mcp-server/run.sh` and appends `/plugins/corezoid` only if the direct path doesn't exist, instead of assuming one fixed layout; fails with a clear error if neither layout matches instead of a cryptic `exec` failure.
- Fix: `install-kiro.sh` now sed-substitutes `settings/mcp.json` from `.mcp.kiro.json` instead of duplicating the MCP command/args inline, keeping the two in lock-step.
- Fix: sync version drift that had accumulated across `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.kiro-plugin/plugin.json`, and the repo-root `POWER.md` (stale at `2.8.0`/`2.7.0` and an outdated 18-skill count vs. the actual 21).
- Docs: reword `steering/corezoid.md`'s tool-routing note to be accurate for both the workspace-install skill layout and the Kiro Power steering layout; the always-on guardrails file now also ships in the Power bundle as `steering/corezoid-guardrails.md`.
- Chore: gitignore the `power-corezoid/` build output.

## [2.8.1]

- Fix: AWS Kiro MCP server failed to start after `install-kiro.sh` — the `.mcp.kiro.json` fallback path pointed two directory levels above the actual `mcp-server/run.sh` location. The installer now resolves `PLUGIN_ROOT` to an absolute path and bakes it into the generated `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` at install time, matching how skills are already handled.
- Docs: add AWS Kiro install/update instructions to `README.md`.
## [Unreleased]

- Feat: `layout-process` places every error cluster next to the node it protects. Waterfall and region strategies pin each Reply/Error cluster beside its owner in the compact staircase distilled from hand-tuned production layouts (retry Delay level with the owner's row, its Condition directly below), sinks owned by a single column stay in that column, and nodes are nudged off short link lines when a collision-free spot exists. The layered strategy's error rail got a monotone cursor so clusters of same-row owners no longer pile onto one point, and count-semaphor `esc_node_id` targets are now treated as error edges instead of drifting to the orphan grid.
- Feat: code-enforced node placement on `push-process` — new nodes added with placeholder coordinates (`x: 0, y: 0`) are auto-placed by the MCP server. Preserve mode is the default: already-placed nodes are never moved, only the new `(0,0)` nodes are slotted near their graph neighbours without overlap; a fully-new process gets a clean layered layout. Disable with the environment variable `COREZOID_AUTOLAYOUT=off`.
- Feat: `layout-process` MCP tool — the deterministic auto-layout engine (waterfall for simple trees, sugiyama-lite + error rail for meshes, aligned TABLE/STAR region grids), fully in Go inside convctl. It rewrites only `x`/`y` and the `extra.modeForm` collapse flag, preserves the source file's indentation and trailing newline, and always reports the chosen strategy, canvas size and overlap count; `dry=true` previews without writing, `density=compact|medium|roomy` controls spacing. The corezoid-node-layout skill now drives this tool — its Python scripts are gone (single-runtime plugin), with the 12 layout invariants running as ordinary go tests plus golden coordinate files. Also fixes the hybrid strategy dropping `modeForm=collapse` on residual-graph nodes (they rendered as full blocks shifted by the collapsed offset).
- Feature: new `corezoid-node-layout` skill — auto-arranges a process's node x/y into a clean, readable layout and rewrites the `.conv.json` in place (positions + IF/Delay/error collapse only; edges, logic, `conv_id`, aliases and node types are left byte-for-byte intact). Business logic is laid out as a vertical top-to-bottom spine; error handling (escalation → reply → error-final, reachable only via `err_node_id`) is collapsed into a tidy right-hand rail; unreachable orphans go into a compact grid. Guarantees no node overlaps and coordinates within Corezoid's ±10000 canvas (the vertical step shrinks for very deep processes). Simple tree-like processes use a "waterfall" (branches fanned around a central column); large mesh processes use a layered algorithm (dummy nodes for long edges + median crossing-minimisation + priority coordinate straightening). The engine is implemented in Go inside the plugin's MCP server (the `layout-process` tool above — single-runtime plugin, no Python); its clean-layout invariants run as ordinary go tests. Complements the existing `docs/process/node-positioning-best-practices.md`. Run it as the last step before `push-process`.
- Fix: `deploy-stage` no longer refuses a deploy with a false "unexpected/conflicting status" when a process was deleted on the source stage. `/api/2/compare` reports such objects as `"deleted"` (the status the tool expected, `"removed"`, has never been observed in the API); the UI merge propagates the deletion without complaint, and the tool now does the same — the object counts toward the "will be DELETED from the target" warning instead of aborting. Reproduced live: deploy dev→prod, delete the process on dev, dry-run → previously `⛔ 1 object(s) returned an unexpected/conflicting status`.
- Fix: `deploy-stage` failures are now diagnosable. A failed compare (e.g. "One or more processes has errors") carries a nested `errors` tree naming the exact stage → process → node and the reason (empty scheme, orphan node, a reference into another project, …); the tool previously swallowed it and printed only the bare description. A genuinely unrecognized compare status now also lists each offending object with its id, title and the literal status value instead of an anonymous count.
- Fix: `deploy-stage` gives a definitive good/bad verdict when the progress WebSocket fails (small merges routinely finish and close it before the monitor subscribes). The outcome is decided by the scheme itself: compare is re-run with retries — an empty diff reports a verified success, a leftover diff reports UNCONFIRMED as an error. Previously every fast merge ended with a scary "completion could not be confirmed over the WebSocket" warning on a successful deploy.
- Feat: full env-var lifecycle from the IDE — `list-variables`, `modify-variable` and `delete-variable` MCP tools. Both write tools are dry-run-by-default and confirm-gated (`confirm="<short_name>#<obj_id>"`): modify shows a current → new diff (rename additionally scans local `.conv.json` files for `{{env_var[@old-name]}}` references), delete shows a red permanent-deletion warning block that the AI must present to the user verbatim — env vars have NO recycle bin. Secrets are always masked in every output; server semantics verified live: modify is partial (omitted fields — including a secret's value — are preserved), `env_var_type` cannot be changed after creation (the server silently ignores it), delete requires project/stage ids.

## [2.8.0]

- Feat: process snapshots — new MCP handlers (`create-snapshot`, `list-snapshots`, `restore-snapshot`) and an auto-snapshot taken before every `push-process`; snapshot titles include a timestamp and the `.env` write notice is surfaced back to the user.
- Feat: `deploy-stage` and `set-stage-immutable` MCP tools — deploy from one stage to another (with a source-stage-deployed precheck) and mark a stage immutable without leaving the IDE.
- Feat: `git_call` node support in `push-process` — schema validation for `api_git`/`git_call` (including `code_error`), multi-language build-log integration tests across all runtimes, and the build log is surfaced in the push result on failure.
- Feat: `run-task` polls for the final node and accepts a `wait_sec` parameter for long-running tasks.
- Feat: capture MCP client identity (`clientInfo.name`/`version` from the `initialize` handshake) and attach it as `client_name`/`client_version` to every analytics event; both stdio and HTTP transports parse it via one shared `parseInitializeParams()`.
- Feat: flush buffered analytics events on shutdown — SIGINT/SIGTERM and deferred exit paths drain the sender queue synchronously instead of losing anything short of the 20-event/5s batch threshold.
- Feat: new skills — `corezoid-gitcall` (build/publish git_call nodes), `corezoid-describe` (safe process-description updates), and `corezoid-retro` (retrospective analysis).
- Fix: return HTTP 404 when a request carries an `Mcp-Session-Id` the server doesn't recognize, per the Streamable HTTP spec. Previously it silently degraded to the process-global client identity with no signal to the client that its session was gone. `initialize`, notifications, and unsessioned requests keep the existing graceful-fallback behaviour.
- Fix: track MCP client identity per HTTP session (keyed by `Mcp-Session-Id`, threaded through `context.Context` into `handleToolCall`) instead of a single process-global. In HTTP mode one server process serves many concurrent clients, and the previous global let the most recent `initialize` silently overwrite every other client's analytics attribution. Adds a 1h idle-session sweep. Covered by a 20-client concurrency test through `httptest.Server`.
- Fix: guard the remaining MCP client-identity globals with a mutex (`clientSupportsElicitation`, `clientName`, `clientVersion`); reads go through `clientElicitationSupported()`/`clientIdentitySnapshot()`, mirroring the existing `authStateMu` pattern. Caught by `-race` and reproduced with a torn-pair concurrency test.
- Fix: guard `stopAnalytics()` with a `sync.Once` — three call sites (deferred, signal handler, HTTP-error path) previously blocked on `analyticsFlushCh` for up to 2s after the sender goroutine had already exited.
- Fix: `api_copy` compare/merge operations now route to their own `/api/2` endpoints.
- Fix: allow object cast in `go_if_const` conditions.
- Fix: `pull-folder` skips hidden directories and handles permission errors instead of aborting the walk.
- Fix: accept absolute paths that resolve inside the project root.
- Docs: expand `corezoid-api-integration.md` to a full pattern reference.
- Docs: dedicated per-node error-cluster pattern in `error-handling.md`.
- Docs: node-positioning best-practices note.
- Docs: `README.md` lists the new `corezoid-gitcall` skill.

## [2.7.0]

- Feat: AWS Kiro support — the same plugin payload now installs on Kiro alongside Claude Code and Codex via a symmetric overlay (`plugins/corezoid/.kiro-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/corezoid/.mcp.kiro.json`, `plugins/corezoid/steering/corezoid.md`, and a root-level `POWER.md` distribution manifest for kiro.dev/powers).
- Feat: `plugins/corezoid/scripts/install-kiro.sh` sets up an existing Kiro workspace from a cloned repo. Copies the MCP entry, symlinks steering files, and hard-copies each skill into `.kiro/skills/<name>/` while sed-substituting every `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (and braced `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) token with the absolute plugin path so reference-doc paths resolve under Kiro. Idempotent.
- Feat: `corezoid-stage-scan` skill — offline pre-merge/pre-deploy static validator for exported stage `.zip`s (or extracted dirs). Detects non-active processes, empty/battered processes, broken intra-process node links (`to_node_id`/`err_node_id`), and broken/inactive cross-process `conv_id` references. Maps findings to the platform's merge "Errors list" messages. Ships a stdlib-only Python scanner with CI-friendly exit codes (`scripts/scan_stage.py`); each finding carries a `folder` field with the human-readable folder path in the stage tree.
- Feat: `delete-process` MCP tool — move a process to Trash without leaving the IDE.
- Docs: `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` inside SKILL.md is a host-side text substitution Claude Code performs at skill-load time (anthropics/claude-code#48230). Codex resolves the same token by the same name; there is currently no mechanism to register a host-neutral alias, so the token name stays as `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` across all skills and `install-kiro.sh` resolves it at install time for Kiro.
- CI: package and attach the `.kiro` overlay and `POWER.md` to GitHub Releases; ignore `${VAR}` placeholder paths in the markdown link check.

## [2.6.0]

- Feat: `send-feedback` MCP tool — submits user feedback to a dedicated Corezoid process (`conv_id 1871779`) and returns a ticket id. Does not require authentication so users can report auth-related issues too.
- Feat: `corezoid-feedback` skill — UX layer for the feedback flow: detects when a result was unexpected, collects problem/expected/solution, shows the full payload for confirmation, then calls `send-feedback`.
- Feat: opt-in email telemetry — after first successful login, users are asked (via elicitation) if they want to share their email with the Corezoid team; stored in `~/.corezoid/preferences.json`, included as `user_email` in analytics events.
- Refactor: all telemetry values (analytics + feedback endpoint and conv_id) centralised in `telemetry_config.go`; individually overridable via `COREZOID_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT`, `COREZOID_ANALYTICS_CONV_ID`, `COREZOID_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT`, `COREZOID_FEEDBACK_CONV_ID`. Existing default behavior unchanged.
- Security: secret redaction applied to all feedback fields before transmission (Bearer tokens, JWTs, `api_key`/`token`/`password`/`secret` values, hex strings ≥ 32 chars). Feedback disabled by `COREZOID_FEEDBACK_DISABLED=1`.
- Fix: allow templated/dynamic `conv_id` in `api_copy` nodes (align schema with `api_rpc`).
- Fix: detect and disallow passthrough escalation nodes during lint.
- Docs: api-call — require the full canonical api logic shape; a "light" node fails the deploy.
- Docs: api-call — correct `customize_response=false` behavior; document response-body placement and silent mapping failure.
- Docs: params — document the exact valid params element shape and that params are optional for receiving data.
- Docs: set-param — document nested env_var keys and expand `conv[].ref[]` rules.
- Docs: delay-node — clarify the 30s limit is static-literal only; document dynamic absolute-timestamp timers.
- Docs: delay-node — make timestamp source explicitly irrelevant (set_param is one example).
- Docs: node-ids — document server reassignment and stability of node IDs on push.
- Docs: updated SECURITY.md telemetry section to disclose optional email opt-in and how to remove it.
- Chore: MCP server log file moved from `/tmp/corezoid.log` to `~/.corezoid/mcp.log` for easier discoverability.

## [2.5.0]

- Feat: Project CRUD MCP tools — create-project, modify-project, delete-project, show-project — for managing Corezoid projects without leaving the IDE.
- Feat: Folder CRUD MCP tools — show-folder, list-folders, modify-folder, delete-folder — for working with the folder hierarchy.
- Feat: corezoid-api-connector skill with a sample API-node-list process for wiring external API integrations.
- Refactor: API-key Principal uses login obj_id (int) instead of the login string; drops the extra show_api_key round-trip. Note: changes the on-disk format under ~/.corezoid/api-keys/ — `login` is now a JSON number.
- Fix: bump OAuth PKCE token-exchange timeout from 30s to 60s to avoid silent failures on slow networks.

## [2.4.0]

- Feat: corezoid-access skill and MCP tools for user groups, API keys, and object/folder sharing.
- Feat: corezoid-state-diagram-create and corezoid-state-diagram-edit skills with a create-state-diagram MCP tool for building and modifying state-diagram processes.
- Feat: corezoid-process-optimizer skill for auditing existing processes for performance and structural issues.
- Feat: corezoid-alias-manager and corezoid-variable-manager skills for working with aliases and environment variables.
- Feat: get-node-stat MCP tool exposing node archive statistics.
- Feat: AI discovery files — llms.txt and .well-known/skills/index.json — with a generator script under scripts/.
- Feat: context7 integration for live documentation lookups.
- Docs: full state-diagram documentation set under plugins/corezoid/docs/state-diagrams/ (overview, node structures, process interaction).
- Docs: clarifications in call-process, copy-task, set-state, set-parameters dynamic values, and variables-guide nodes.
- Docs: bundle docs/corezoid-swagger.json as a canonical Corezoid REST API reference.
- Chore: unit tests for mcp-server analytics, access, config, and helpers.
- CI: minor tweak to release.yml.

## [2.3.9]

- Docs: clarify in SECURITY.md that Go is not required on supported prebuilt platforms; only needed for developer/fallback scenarios.
- Docs: expand "older tags" support policy — security fixes are released as new versions only.
- Chore: add comment to .gitignore explaining why `/.mcp.json` is root-level only (prevents accidental `**/.mcp.json` breakage).

## [2.3.8]

- Docs: remove Go requirement from README — prebuilt binary is the only supported install path; Go fallback remains silent for developers.
- Docs: add telemetry disclosure block in the Installation section with opt-out example (`COREZOID_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1`).
- Feat: run.sh — add `COREZOID_MCP_DEV=1` override and prefer local `./convctl` binary for developer workflows.
- Fix: gitignore `.mcp.json` to prevent local MCP config from being committed.

## [2.3.7]

- Feat: `--version` flag injected at build time via ldflags; defaults to `"dev"` for local builds.
- CI: validate `run.sh` syntax with `sh -n` on every push/PR; run `go run . --version` as a smoke test after build.
- Security: GitHub Artifact Attestations (`actions/attest-build-provenance`) for all release binaries, providing verifiable supply-chain provenance beyond SHA256 checksums.

## [2.3.6]

- Feat: prebuilt MCP server binaries (darwin/linux × amd64/arm64) distributed via GitHub Releases; run.sh downloads and caches the binary on first start, falls back to `go run .` when unavailable.
- Security: SHA256 checksum verification against release checksums.txt before executing a downloaded binary.
- Security: remove workspace_id and stage_id from anonymous telemetry events.
- Fix: logout confirmation message now shows `~/.corezoid/credentials` instead of project `.env`.
- Fix: mid-session environment switching — login/logout now correctly reload and persist changed account URL, workspace ID, and stage ID.
- Docs: add Telemetry section to README with opt-out instructions (`COREZOID_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1`).
- Docs: clarify Go 1.24+ is required only as a fallback, not when a prebuilt binary is available.
- CI: attach per-platform SHA256 `checksums.txt` to every GitHub Release.

## [2.3.5]

- Feat: store ACCESS_TOKEN in ~/.corezoid/credentials instead of project .env to prevent accidental git leaks.
- Feat: add anonymous tool-call analytics (opt-out via COREZOID_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1).
- Fix: sync version and license across all four manifests (.agents/plugins/marketplace.json was missing both fields).
- Fix: replace conv_id with process_id in pull-process examples across four skill files.
- Docs: update SECURITY.md with two-layer credential model, network activity, and analytics disclosure.
- Docs: update corezoid-init/SKILL.md and README to reflect new credential file location.

## [2.3.4]

- Fix: always ask user to choose workspace/project/stage on `login` instead of auto-selecting.
- Codex plugin version bumped to 2.3.4.
- Add project-level commit skill with automatic version bump.

## [2.3.3]

- Remove redundant "Environment Context" section from skill documentation.

## [2.3.2]

- Fix: allow `list-workspaces`, `list-projects`, `list-stages` tools to work with token-only auth (no full `ensureAuth` required).

## [2.3.1]

- Fix: rewrite Mode B login flow to use explicit MCP tool calls instead of elicitation when client does not support it.

## [2.3.0]

- Feat: MCP server returns an actionable auth error message pointing to the `corezoid-init` skill when credentials are missing.
- Feat: support personal workspaces (accounts with no `WORKSPACE_ID`).
- Fix: skip OAuth browser flow when `ACCESS_TOKEN` is already present in `.env`.

## [2.2.0]

- Feat: add chat-based fallback login flow for Claude clients that do not support the elicitation protocol.
- Fix: update plugin update command to use `name@marketplace` format in README.

## [2.1.0]

- Feat: automatically pull the remote folder to disk after the user selects a stage during `login`.

## [2.0.0]

- Complete plugin restructure: Go MCP server replaces the old scripting approach.
- New skills: `corezoid`, `corezoid-init`, `corezoid-create`, `corezoid-edit`, `corezoid-review`, `corezoid-project-review`.
- MCP tools: `login`, `logout`, `pull-process`, `pull-folder`, `push-process`, `lint-process`, `run-task`, `create-process`, `create-folder`, `create-alias`, `create-variable`, `list-workspaces`, `list-projects`, `list-stages`, `list-task-history`, `list-node-tasks`, `modify-task`, `delete-task`, `create-dashboard`, `get-dashboard`, `add-chart`, `modify-chart`, `get-chart`, `set-dashboard-layout`.
- Rename marketplace identifier from `corezoid-ai-plugin` to `corezoid`.
- Simulator.Company was briefly bundled as a second plugin (removed in v2.3.3).

## [1.3.1]

- Initial public release of the Corezoid AI plugin for Claude Code and Codex.
- Go MCP server with tools for login, pull, push, lint, run-task, and process management.
