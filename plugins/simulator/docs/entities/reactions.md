# Reactions

Reactions in the Simulator.Company platform enable users to interact with actors through comments, approvals, ratings, and other feedback mechanisms.

## Overview

Reactions provide a way for users to collaborate and interact with actors in the system. They are implemented as specialized actors organized in a hierarchical tree structure, allowing for threaded comments, nested replies, and structured feedback.

## Properties

Reactions are stored as actors with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the reaction |
| acc_id | String | Workspace ID the reaction belongs to |
| user_id | Integer | ID of the user who created the reaction |
| form_id | Integer | ID of the reaction form template (system form) |
| title | Text | Display title of the reaction |
| data | JSON | Reaction data (comment text, rating value, etc.) |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |
| updated_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of last update |

## Reaction Tree Structure

Reactions are organized in a hierarchical tree structure using the ActorsTreeEdges model:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the tree edge |
| root_actor_id | String | ID of the root actor (the actor being reacted to) |
| actor_id | String | ID of the reaction actor |
| parent_id | String | ID of the parent reaction (for nested replies) |
| branch_id | String | ID of the branch (for organizing reactions) |
| edge_type_id | Integer | ID of the edge type (defining the reaction type) |
| level | Integer | Nesting level in the reaction tree |
| path | Text | Path string representing the position in the tree |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |
| updated_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of last update |

## Reaction Types

The platform supports various reaction types:

- **Comments** - Text-based feedback or notes
- **Approvals** - Acceptance or rejection decisions
- **Ratings** - Numerical or star-based evaluations
- **Reactions** - Emoji-based quick reactions (like, love, etc.)
- **Mentions** - References to other users
- **Tasks** - Assigned work items

## API Endpoints

For detailed API documentation on reactions, including request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements, please refer to the official API documentation:

[Reactions API Documentation](https://doc.simulator.company/#tag/reactions)

The API provides endpoints for:

- Getting all reactions for a specific actor
- Creating new reactions
- Retrieving specific reaction details
- Updating existing reactions
- Deleting reactions
- Replying to existing reactions
- Getting reaction statistics

All API requests require appropriate OAuth2 scopes (`control.events:actors.readonly` for read operations and `control.events:actors.management` for write operations).

## Database Structure

Reactions use multiple tables to implement their functionality:

- Reactions are stored as actors in the `actors` table
- The hierarchical structure is stored in the `actors_tree_edges` table
- Reaction types are defined as edge types in the `edges_types` table

## Example

### Comment Reaction

```json
{
  "id": "reaction_123456",
  "title": "Comment",
  "data": {
    "text": "This looks good, but we should consider adding more details to the customer profile.",
    "mentions": ["user_789"]
  },
  "user_id": 42,
  "created_at": 1621459200,
  "updated_at": 1621459200
}
```

### Reaction Tree

```json
{
  "root_actor_id": "actor_789012",
  "reactions": [
    {
      "id": "reaction_123456",
      "title": "Comment",
      "data": {
        "text": "This looks good, but we should consider adding more details."
      },
      "user_id": 42,
      "created_at": 1621459200,
      "replies": [
        {
          "id": "reaction_234567",
          "title": "Reply",
          "data": {
            "text": "I agree, I'll update the profile with additional information."
          },
          "user_id": 56,
          "created_at": 1621545600
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "reaction_345678",
      "title": "Approval",
      "data": {
        "status": "approved",
        "notes": "Approved with minor changes requested."
      },
      "user_id": 78,
      "created_at": 1621632000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-time Updates

Reactions support real-time updates through:

- WebSocket notifications for new reactions
- Real-time updates when reactions are modified
- Notification system for mentions and replies

## Usage in the Platform

Reactions are used throughout the platform for various purposes:

- **Collaboration** - Enabling team discussions on business processes
- **Approvals** - Supporting approval workflows and sign-offs
- **Feedback** - Collecting user feedback on processes and documents
- **Task Management** - Assigning and tracking tasks related to actors
- **Notifications** - Alerting users to important updates and mentions

Reactions form a key part of the platform's collaboration features, enabling users to interact with business processes and with each other in a structured way.
