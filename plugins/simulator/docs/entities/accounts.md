# Accounts

Accounts in the Simulator.Company platform represent financial entities that can track balances, transactions, and transfers between different actors.

## Overview

Accounts are used to track financial information within the platform. Each account has a name, currency, and can be associated with actors to track balances and transactions. The platform supports various account types, including formula-based accounts that calculate their balances based on other accounts.

## Account Components

The account system consists of several components:

### Account Names

Account names define the categories or types of accounts available in a workspace.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the account name |
| acc_id | String | Workspace ID the account name belongs to |
| user_id | Integer | ID of the user who created the account name |
| name | Text | Name of the account |
| is_system | Boolean | Whether this is a system account name |
| abbreviation | String | Short abbreviation for the account name |
| status | Enum | Status of the account name (active, removed) |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |
| updated_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of last update |

### Account Currencies

Account currencies define the types of currencies that can be used in accounts.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Unique identifier for the currency |
| acc_id | String | Workspace ID the currency belongs to |
| user_id | Integer | ID of the user who created the currency |
| name | Text | Name of the currency |
| symbol | String | Symbol representing the currency |
| precision | Integer | Number of decimal places for the currency |
| type | Enum | Type of currency (number, etc.) |
| is_system | Boolean | Whether this is a system currency |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |

### Actors Accounts

Actors Accounts link financial accounts to specific actors, tracking balances and transactions.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the account |
| actor_id | String | ID of the actor this account belongs to |
| user_id | Integer | ID of the user who created the account |
| name_id | String | ID of the account name |
| type | Enum | Account type (operational, analytical, etc.) |
| counter_type | Enum | Counter type for metrics (amount, count) |
| income_type | Enum | Income classification (debit, credit) |
| currency_id | Integer | ID of the currency for this account |
| amount | Decimal | Current balance amount |
| hold_amount | Decimal | Amount currently on hold |
| system_type | Enum | Whether the account is manual or system-managed |
| status | Enum | Account status (active, removed, blocked) |
| formula | Text | Formula for calculated accounts |
| min_limit | Decimal | Minimum balance limit |
| max_limit | Decimal | Maximum balance limit |
| search | Boolean | Whether the account appears in search results |
| tree_calculation | Boolean | Whether the account participates in hierarchical calculations |
| connectors | Boolean | Whether the account uses external connectors |
| limit_service_url | String | URL for external limit service |
| commission_service_url | String | URL for external commission service |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |
| updated_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of last update |

### Account Formulas

Account Formulas define relationships between source accounts and calculated accounts for formula-based balance calculations.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Unique identifier for the formula relationship |
| source_account_id | String | ID of the source account used in the formula |
| calc_account_id | String | ID of the calculated account using the formula |
| user_id | Integer | ID of the user who created the formula relationship |
| created_at | Integer | Unix timestamp of creation time |

## Formula-Based Accounts

The platform supports formula-based accounts that calculate their balances using mathematical expressions referencing other accounts. These accounts:

- Use the `formula` field in ActorsAccounts to define the calculation expression
- Track dependencies between accounts using the AccountFormulas table
- Support complex mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Can reference other accounts by ID or by using special variables
- Update automatically when source accounts change
- Can be used for aggregation, allocation, and other financial calculations

## Account Types

The platform supports several account types:

- **Operational** - Standard accounts for tracking actual balances
- **Analytical** - Accounts for analysis and reporting
- **Formula** - Accounts with balances calculated from other accounts
- **System** - System-managed accounts for internal operations

## API Endpoints

For detailed API documentation on accounts, including request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements, please refer to the official API documentation:

[Accounts API Documentation](https://doc.simulator.company/#tag/accounts)
[Account Names API Documentation](https://doc.simulator.company/#tag/account-names)
[Currencies API Documentation](https://doc.simulator.company/#tag/currencies)

The API provides endpoints for:

- Getting all account names in a workspace
- Creating new account names
- Getting all currencies in a workspace
- Creating new currencies
- Getting all accounts for a specific actor
- Creating new accounts for actors
- Updating existing accounts
- Deleting accounts

All API requests require appropriate OAuth2 scopes (`control.events:accounts.readonly` for read operations and `control.events:accounts.management` for write operations).

## Transactions and Transfers

Accounts can have transactions and transfers:

- **Transactions**: Record financial activities within an account
- **Transfers**: Move funds between accounts

See the [Transactions](./transactions.md) and [Transfers](./transfers.md) documentation for more details.

## Hierarchical Balance Calculation

The platform supports hierarchical balance calculation through the `tree_calculation` flag:

- Parent accounts can automatically aggregate balances from child accounts
- Changes to child accounts propagate up the hierarchy
- Hierarchical relationships are defined through actor links with the hierarchy edge type
- This enables organizational rollups and departmental aggregations

## External Integrations

Accounts can integrate with external systems through:

- `limit_service_url` - External service for dynamic limit calculations
- `commission_service_url` - External service for commission calculations
- `connectors` flag - Enables integration with external financial systems
