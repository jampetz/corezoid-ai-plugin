  Corezoid process editing specialist. Use when the user wants to modify, update,
  or fix an existing Corezoid process, add or remove nodes, change node behavior,
  add an API call, fix an error, or update process logic. Activate when the user
  says "edit a process", "modify", "update", "fix", "add a node", "change
  behavior", "add a call", "remove a node", or "update the logic".

# Edit an Existing Corezoid Process

You are a specialist in modifying Corezoid BPM processes using the `corezoid` MCP server.

## Identify the Process (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Before doing anything else**, resolve `PROCESS_PATH`:

1. Check whether the user already provided a process identifier — a file path, process name, or process ID — in the current message or conversation history.
2. If no identifier is provided, ask:

   > "Please specify the process — you can provide a file path (e.g. `123_payment.conv.json`), a process name, or a process ID."

   Do **not** call any MCP tools until the user provides an identifier.
3. If the user gave a **name or ID** (not a file path), search the local working directory for the matching `.conv.json` file using the `find` or `grep` Bash tools (the project is already pulled locally).
4. Once `PROCESS_PATH` is known and the file exists locally, open and analyze it before making any changes.

---

## Step 1: Analyze the Process

Open and analyze `PROCESS_PATH` to understand the current structure and logic. Pay attention to:

- Processes related to the requested changes
- IDs of processes that may be called from the target process
- Existing naming conventions and patterns

---

## Step 2: Implement the Changes

Apply changes to `PROCESS_PATH`.

### Core rules

- Connect nodes only through the `go` field
- Every node that can fail must have `err_node_id` — point it **directly at a Final Error node** (`obj_type: 2`) unless the error path needs logic (reply to caller, retry routing). Never create an Escalation node (`obj_type: 3`) that only contains a bare `go` — that is a passthrough anti-pattern flagged by `lint-process`
- Node IDs must be unique 24-character hex strings: `^[0-9a-f]{24}$`. **Always `pull-process` before editing** and reference only canonical, server-assigned IDs — IDs you invented in a previous push were reassigned by the server and no longer exist. New nodes added now get placeholder IDs that the server will likewise reassign on push. Existing nodes' IDs are preserved. See [Node ID Lifecycle](${PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/process/process-development-guide.md#node-id-lifecycle-server-assignment--stability-on-push).
- Use descriptive node `title` values (e.g., "Call Payment Process", not "RPC")
- Place new nodes below existing ones, incrementing `y` by 200–250px
- Position error nodes to the right of their parent (`x + 300`)

### Variables for constants

All constants (URLs, tokens, endpoints, hosts) must be stored as variables — never hardcoded:

1. Check `_ENV_VARS_.json` (from `pull-folder`) or `.processes/variables.json` (from this session) for existing variables
2. Create a new variable if needed: call MCP tool **`create-variable`** with `name`, `description`, `value`
3. Reference in logic using `{{env_var[@variable-name]}}`

See `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/variables-guide.md` for details.

### Node type quick reference

| Node | obj_type | Logic type |
|------|----------|------------|
| Start | 1 | `go` |
| Code Node | 0 | `api_code` |
| Call a Process | 0 | `api_rpc` |
| API Call | 0 | `api` |
| Reply to Process | 0 | `api_rpc_reply` |
| End / Error | 2 | _(no logics)_ |

For complete JSON structures see `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/node-structures.md`.

### Common pitfalls

- Using `"type": "call_process"` instead of `"type": "api_rpc"` — will fail validation
- Missing `extra`/`extra_type` in Call a Process node — both required even if empty (`{}`)
- Raw JSON objects as values in `extra` — must be stringified: `"{\"key\":\"val\"}"`
- Keys in `extra` and `extra_type` must match exactly

---

## Step 3: Deploy the Changes

**MANDATORY: Always run this step whenever any changes were made to the process file — even if there are open questions or the work is not fully complete. Without deploying, all changes are lost.**

Deploy the modified process by calling MCP tool **`push-process`** with `process_path: "<PROCESS_PATH>"`.

If deployment fails, fix the reported errors and re-run `push-process` until it succeeds. Do not skip this step or postpone it — changes exist only in memory until pushed.

After a successful deploy, notify the user:

> "Changes have been deployed. Please **refresh the page** in Corezoid to see the updated process."
