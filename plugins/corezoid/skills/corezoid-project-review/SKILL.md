  Corezoid project review and audit specialist. Use when the user wants to
  review or audit an entire Corezoid project or folder — multiple processes at
  once. Activate when the user says "review project", "audit project",
  "review all processes", "audit all processes", "review folder",

  "find issues across processes", "review the whole project", or "audit folder".

# Review a Corezoid Project

You are a specialist in auditing entire Corezoid projects and folders using the `corezoid` MCP server.

Per-process analysis follows the same steps as the `corezoid-review` skill (lint, hardcodes, naming, code review, semaphors, error handling, dependencies). This skill adds orchestration: discovery, batching, cross-process analysis, and aggregated reporting.

---

## Phase 0 — Project Discovery

### Step 0.1: Verify Environment

Read `.env` from the current working directory and check for `COREZOID_STAGE_ID`.

- If `COREZOID_STAGE_ID` is **missing or empty** → stop and invoke the `corezoid-init` skill. Do not proceed until init completes.
- If `COREZOID_STAGE_ID` is present → use it as the root `folder_id` for the review scope.

### Step 0.2: Build Process Inventory

Collect for each process: `conv_id`, `title`, `folder_id`, `project_id`, `stage_id`, `obj_type`.
Store as `process_inventory[]`. Skip objects where `obj_type != conveyor` unless explicitly requested.

### Step 0.3: Announce Scope

Before starting, report:

```
Found N processes in project "<project_name>":
  - Process A (conv_id: 12345)
  - Process B (conv_id: 67890)
  ...
Proceeding with full review.
```

Process all sizes automatically without confirmation. Stream progress in batches of 10.

---

## Phase 1 — Per-Process Audit

For each process in `process_inventory[]`:

1. Pull the process with MCP tool **`pull-process`** using `process_id`
2. Run the full per-process audit (same steps as `corezoid-review` skill):
   - **Step 1** Structural lint (`lint-process`)
   - **Step 2** Load and parse nodes
   - **Step 3** Hardcode check
   - **Step 4** Repeated logic
   - **Step 5** Cycle verification
   - **Step 6** Node naming
   - **Step 7** Code node analysis
   - **Step 8** Semaphor coverage
   - **Step 9** Error handling review
   - **Step 10** External dependencies inventory
3. Store result as `process_reports[conv_id]`
4. Log progress: `Reviewed N/total: "<title>" — X findings`

## Phase 2 — Cross-Process Analysis

Requires all `process_reports[]` from Phase 1.

### Step 2.1: Dependency Graph

Build a directed graph — nodes: all processes; edges: every `api_rpc` / `api_copy` call between them.

Flag:
- ⚠️ **Circular dependencies** — A calls B which calls A
- ⚠️ **Orphaned processes** — never called and no direct external input
- ⚠️ **High fan-in** — called by > 5 other processes (single point of failure)
- ⚠️ **High fan-out** — calls > 7 other processes (coupling risk)
- ℹ️ **External calls** — `conv_id` values pointing outside the project inventory

> This graph is scoped to the current project inventory. For an interactive,
> zoomable view of the same whole-stage graph (built in one pass from the
> already-pulled local files, external references flagged separately), or a
> recursive cross-project crawl from one specific process, optionally run
> `/corezoid-dependency-graph` (Stage-Wide Mode or Single-Process Mode).

### Step 2.2: Duplicate Logic Across Processes

- Two processes with identical or >80% similar `api_code` nodes → candidate for shared subprocess
- Two processes calling the same external URL with same parameters → candidate for shared wrapper process

### Step 2.3: Shared Hardcoded Values

Aggregate only normalized `hardcode.*` findings from per-process reports. Do **not** aggregate dynamic Corezoid expressions, `dependency.state_store_ref`, or values fully wrapped in `{{...}}` as shared hardcodes.

- Same URL in > 2 processes → recommend shared `env_var` (use `/corezoid-variable-manager` to create)
- Same numeric `conv_id` in > 1 process → one alias fix resolves all
- Same token/key fragment in > 1 process → security risk, centralize immediately via `/corezoid-variable-manager` as `secret` variable
- Same status string in > 2 processes → recommend shared constant or `env_var`
- Same error text in > 1 process → recommend shared text constant

False-positive guard (same as per-process review):
- Ignore values that are fully dynamic expressions, e.g. `{{conv[@storage].ref[{{key}}].field}}`
- If a shared value is a state-store alias, report it under dependency analysis instead of `cross_process.shared_hardcode_value`
- Recompute aggregate summary counts after removing false positives

### Step 2.4: Alias Consistency

Flag:
- Same alias used with both `create` and `modify` in different processes → race condition risk
- Alias defined in one process but used with numeric `conv_id` in another → inconsistency
- Aliases referenced in processes but absent from project inventory → undocumented external dependency

To fix alias issues found here (create missing aliases, rename, repoint, delete conflicts),
use the `/corezoid-alias-manager` skill.

### Step 2.5: Naming Consistency

Flag:
- Same vague name used widely (e.g. 10+ nodes named `"error"` across project) → recommend naming standard
- Mixed conventions across processes (`Create_X` vs `createX`)

---

## Phase 3 — Aggregate Report

Produce two output files: `project-review-<date>.json` and `project-review-<date>.md`.

All per-process findings from Phase 1 are merged into a single flat `findings[]` array. Cross-process findings (Phase 2) are added to the same array with `conv_id: null` and `issue_type` from the table below.

Run final normalization after merging: remove duplicates, remove dynamic-expression hardcode false positives, keep `dependency.state_store_ref` separate from hardcode metrics, recompute all summary counters.

### Cross-Process Issue Types

| issue_type | issue_subtype | severity |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| `cross_process` | `circular_dependency` | high |
| `cross_process` | `orphaned_process` | warning |
| `cross_process` | `high_fan_in` | warning |
| `cross_process` | `high_fan_out` | warning |
| `cross_process` | `external_call` | low |
| `cross_process` | `shared_hardcode_url` | high |
| `cross_process` | `shared_hardcode_token` | high |
| `cross_process` | `shared_hardcode_value` | medium |
| `cross_process` | `duplicate_logic` | low |
| `cross_process` | `alias_conflict` | warning |
| `cross_process` | `naming_convention` | low |

Cross-process finding example:

```json
{
  "conv_id": null,
  "process_title": null,
  "node_id": null,
  "node_title": null,
  "issue_type": "cross_process",
  "issue_subtype": "shared_hardcode_url",
  "severity": "high",
  "value": "https://api.openai.com",
  "location": "found_in: [1779750, 1779754, 1782365]",
  "recommendation": "extract to shared env_var OPENAI_API_URL"
}
```

### Step 3.1: Per-Process Summary Table (Markdown)

| Process | Findings | High | Medium | Warning | Low |
|---------|----------|------|--------|---------|-----|
| Process A (12345) | 12 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 |
| Process B (67890) | 5 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Cross-process | 4 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| **Total** | **N** | | | | |

### Step 3.2: Top Issues List (Markdown)

```
🔴 CRITICAL (fix before release)
  1. [Process A / Node X / semaphor / api_callback_missing] — tasks will hang
  2. [Cross-process / shared_hardcode_token] — token "sk-xxx" in 3 processes — revoke & move to env_var
  3. [Process B / Node Y / hardcode / url] — external URL hardcoded — extract to env_var

🟡 IMPORTANT (fix in next sprint)
  4. [Cross-process / circular_dependency] — Process B → Process A → Process B
  5. [Cross-process / shared_hardcode_url] — https://api.example.com in 4 processes
  6. [Process D / Node Z / dependency / missing_alias] — numeric conv_id 44444 — replace with @alias

⚠️ WARNINGS (technical debt)
  7. [Cross-process / orphaned_process] — Process C never called — possible dead code
  8. [Cross-process / duplicate_logic] — Process A, Process D — identical code nodes
```

### Step 3.3: JSON Output Schema

```json

## Scope Modifiers

| Request | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `"review all processes in folder X"` | Phase 0 scoped to folder_id |
| `"review only stage prod"` | Filter `process_inventory` by `stage_id` |
| `"skip cross-process analysis"` | Phase 1 only, skip Phase 2 |
| `"quick review"` | Skip code node analysis (Step 7) and duplicate logic (Step 2.2) |
| `"review only hardcodes"` | Hardcode check per process + Step 2.3 only |
| `"review only N processes"` | Prioritize by last modified date |
